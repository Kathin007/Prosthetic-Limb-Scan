# Prosthetic-Limb-Scan
A project that consists a ESP-32 and 2 TF-Luna Lidars which maps the residual limb of multiple challenged people or people who have lost their legs or hands during accidents who want a prosthetic leg or hand. The plotly 3D  image makes it easier for the prosthetic designer and also cost efficient for the customer(instead of CT or MRI scan).
